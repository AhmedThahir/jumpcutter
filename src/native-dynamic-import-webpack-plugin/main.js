// This plugin is inspired by https://github.com/crimx/webpack-target-webextension
// Why not use that plugin? Because in content scripts it uses `tabs.runtime.executeScript` (not `import()`),
// which requires the extension to have 'activeTab' or host permission, and it's good to require as little permissions
// as possible.
